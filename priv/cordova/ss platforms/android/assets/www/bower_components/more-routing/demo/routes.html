<!--
The first thing any document using more-routing must do is configure the driver.

more-routing supports path (`/foo/bar`) and hash (`#!/foo/bar`) style routes.
-->
<more-routing-config driver="hash"></more-routing-config>

<!--
You can name routes.

It is strongly recommended that you declare all your named routes in an import
such as this, as it acts as a reference for your application, and makes nesting
more clear.
-->
<more-route name="root"  path="/"></more-route>
<more-route name="forum" path="/forum/:forumId">
  <!--
  Named routes can also be nested. The following route maps to
  `/forum/:forumId/:threadId`.
  -->
  <more-route name="thread" path="/:threadId"></more-route>
</more-route>
<more-route name="user" path="/user/:userId">
